# C# Console Mini Project: Menu-Driven Number Utilities

This is a **C# console application** that demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, methods, input validation, and menu-driven applications.

The program includes:

1. **Password Protection**
   - Users must enter the correct password to access the menu.
   - Limits the number of attempts to 3, after which access is blocked.

2. **Menu Options**
   - **Print numbers 1 to N**: Displays all numbers from 1 up to a user-specified number.
   - **Calculate sum 1 to N**: Calculates and displays the sum of numbers from 1 to N.
   - **Exit**: Closes the application.

3. **Input Validation**
   - Ensures users enter valid numbers where required.
   - Handles empty or invalid password and menu input gracefully.
